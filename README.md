# Rails Blawg

![](https://media.giphy.com/media/BDDQCaXmBrhCg/giphy.gif)

This homework's gonna be .... off the rails (is that a good thing or bad thing? Let it be whatever you'd like)

Time to get Rails experience, or else Kanye might never hire you. And if you don't like Kanye, maybe you can get a job with Justin Bieber, Gwyneth Paltrow or someone else universally beloved.

## Setup

Ain't nobody got time for files

## Completion

Completion is out of 6 - one for each user story. Aim to complete the first 4.

## Assignment

#### User Stories
You're creating your very own Blog App in Rails! A user should be able to:
* Land on a welcome page
* See all existing posts
* Create a new post (a post should have an author and content)
* Render an update form for a post with the existing data for that post
* Update a post
* Delete a post

----

#### Approach

Do this with RAILS! What's the general approach we use here?

* Plan what each action should do
* Initialize a new app (don't forget the flags!)
* Create a database
* Create migrations/model files
* Migrate a schema
* Seed as necessary
* Create routes
* Create corresponding controllers and controller actions
* Create welcome view
* Render JSON responses
* Create front-end JS (where should it go?)
